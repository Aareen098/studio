          My journey into the world of technology began with curiosity and a drive to create. As a BCA graduate currently pursuing an MCA from Lovely Professional University, I’ve developed a strong foundation in computer science and an ever-growing passion for crafting responsive and user-friendly web applications. My expertise lies in front-end development and Python programming, where I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional, and visually appealing digital experiences.

          <p>
          I’m also deeply fascinated by cybersecurity, constantly exploring how systems can be protected and optimized in today’s evolving digital landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
          Beyond coding, I believe in continuous learning and innovation — staying up to date with emerging technologies and industry trends. Whether it’s improving my skills, contributing to open-source projects, or experimenting with new frameworks, I’m always eager to grow as a developer and problem-solver.
